<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

In this **Treehouse Tech Degree** project I created a REST API using Express.js. This API will be used to provide information about users and courses to my Full Stack App where users will be able to create new courses, retrieve existing courses, and update or delete existing courses.

To make changes to the database, users will need to be logged into the API and only course owners will be allowed to edit their courses and delete them.

In a future project I will be using React.js to create a front end client which uses this REST API as part of a full stack application.
